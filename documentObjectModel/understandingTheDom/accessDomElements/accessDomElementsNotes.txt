HOW TO ACCESS ELEMENTS IN THE DOM

INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------>
    > The DOM is structured as a tree nodes. Nodes can be text, comments, or 
    elements. Usually when we want to access content in the DOM, it'll be 
    through an HTML element.

    > We can access elements in the DOM by ID, class, tag, and query selectors.
        * getElementById() --> ID
        * getElementsByClassName() --> Class 
        * getElementsByTagName() --> Tag 
        * querySelector() --> Selector (single element)
        * querySelectorAll() --> Selector (all elements)

ACCESSING ELEMENTS BY ID ------------------------------>
    > We can access a single element in the DOM by its unique ID. We select that
    element with getElementById().

    > Accessing in this way is the most efficient at selecting a single 
    element. An ID must always be unique to the page, so that means that 
    by using this method, you can only select one element at a time.

ACCESSING ELEMENTS BY CLASS --------------------------->
    > We can access all of the elements of a given class name by using
    getElementsByClassName(). The class attribute is used to access a 
    group of more specific elements.

    > When we use this method and select multiple elements, we are 
    returned an array-like object of elements. JavaScript arrays must
    be accessed with an index number. So if we want to update a single 
    element of the tag, we'd be able to update the element by using 
    bracket notation. Or, to access all the elements, we can use a for 
    loop to go through every element in the array.

ACCESSING ELEMENTS BY TAG ------------------------------>
    > We can access multiple elements in a less specific way by using
    getElementsByTagName(). This method will also return an array-like
    object of elements. We can modify every element by using a for loop.

QUERY SELECTORS ----------------------------------------->
    > We can use querySelector() to access a single element. The selector 
    for an id attribute is '#' The selector for a class is '.'.
    > If we have a selector with multiple elements, such as a class or 
    a tag, this will return the first element that matches the query.
    > Comma-separated values function as an OR operator

    > If we have a selector with multiple elements, such as a class or 
    a tag, this will return all of the elements that match a specific
    query.
    > We can use the forEach() method to apply our changes to all of the elements.
    > comma-separated values function as an AND operator.
